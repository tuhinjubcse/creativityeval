      <p>
        Carrion Books, one of the 'Big Five' publishers, is located on the south-east of Central Park. On level one is reception and above the reception desk is a huge logo of a purple turkey vulture. Its haughty gaze is directed on the new receptionist's head. Holly Emmerson, who tries to love everything, shudders when she catches its beady eyes, but luckily she's not the type to make eye contact. Holly has only been working at Carrion for a week. She's excited to put calls through and welcome esteemed authors when they visit their editors or publicists. <br><br>
        The reception job was hard to get. Apparently one needs references and experience to land a first job. Emails were sent to publishing companies and bookstores. Holly buttressed her emaciated CV since she's done no study apart from home-schooling and has never worked before. Somehow she landed one interview. She explained to the Facilities Manager that for all her reading life she's read books to her grandmother - who raised her and died three weeks ago - reading for four hours a day. "By the way, you have some powder on your nose," Holly had said, trying to be helpful. The manager laughed. "Powder? You're funny. You're hired."The start of my life is now! Holly realized. The thought made her feel ashamed for wanting something more than she's had but also a dangerous undercurrent of hopeful excitement.<br><br>
        A few days in, more danger of over-excitement soars. Holly stares in awe as Carrion's star author for young adults approaches. "Virginia Garg!" Holly says, jumping in glee then sitting with a sudden inferiority complex. Except... Virginia doesn't resemble her jacket photo. She has unbrushed hair, a mohair poncho, dirty (toothpaste?) trousered legs, and a fanged tooth framed by spinach. She's brought in her mangy dog that looks like her.But wow! An ACTUAL connection with a phenomenal author! Holly is a fan of Virginia's "Galactic Rift" trilogy, especially for the heroine outcast - Ms. Nova Void: "a genetic experiment gone wrong."The famous author stares at Holly's chest. "Red-head, huh? You're new, honey. Nice breasts. You single? Poly?"
        A jealous bark... "Kafka!" says Virginia adoringly to her dog, then turns to Holly. "Today I am lunching with the biggest bitch at Carrion..." She looks at Holly, expecting her to call the bitch to reception."Um... who...?" says Holly. "Sorry." "I told you!" Virginia says. "The biggest bitch here! Audrey. My publicist."
        Holly calls, and soon Head Publicist, Audrey Ford, sashays towards them in perilously high stilettos. "Virginia, daarling!" she says. Whereas Virginia's voice is like a smoker's cough, Audrey's is like a French dove with a near-laughing coo. The women air-kiss. Kafka's teeth make ribbons of Audrey's tights then he howls. Virginia starts howling with him. Between sobs and hiccups, the brilliant author wails, "Help me, Audrey! I can't write it! You can't make me! I've never written a memoir. I can only write novels for young adults because I have arrested development!" She looks defiant like a child refusing bath-time, then lies on the beige couch with Kafka whimpering on her belly and Audrey stroking her forehead.
        "You're amaaazing," says Audrey earnestly. A stream of soothing prattle follows: "You're so talented. You're our favorite author. You're my favorite novelist. You can do it! We have faith in you. You're the BEST writer. You're Carrion's FINEST!"
        On it goes... Holly watches, mesmerized, aghast.
        It works!
        With every honeyed word, Virginia looks less insane. Carrion's treasured author sits up from the couch of beige mediocrity and failure. Smiles at Audrey Ford. Smiles at Holly Emmerson: lowly receptionist. The power-women leave. They don't say goodbye to Holly but Kafka does, raising his leg in au revoir and yellow trickle puddles on the reception floor.
        Holly collects the cleaning equipment with a myriad of feelings, mostly gratitude. What a dream to be in Virginia Garg's orbit, she thinks. Although, would she like to BE Virginia? she wonders. Aah. Perhaps, if it was Virginia MINUS: her fame, her pup, her personality, her clothes sense, her looks, her voice, and her smell of citrus covering wet dog. I am so happy being me, Holly thinks, now I've hit the jackpot here! I want to stay at Carrion Books forever!<br><br>
        Later that week, Holly receives a call from the familiar voice. 
        "Audrey?!"
        "Oh, Virginia! This is Holly, on reception. I will transfer you now to Audrey."
        "Gah, I forgot. There's always a receptionist in the way when I call this number. Whatever, I have news!" says Virginia excitedly. "And, honey, I just had an idea! How 'bout you come to my place after work and I'll tell you my news in the flesh?"
        "Your place... to come over?" squeaks Holly. "Me?!"  
        "You."
        "Oh! Yes! Thank you SO much! Oh! Could we please talk about Nova Void? I feel SUCH a kinship with that character!"
        Virginia provides Holly with her number and address, then Holly transfers the call. Soon, the news spreads through Carrion. Virginia has won the Charlotte's Web Award: the biggest prize in children's and YA publishing! An annual award presented with big money, much international fuss, and kudos for Carrion. Phillip Pullman and JK Rowling are in Manhattan for the award ceremony! Holly hears snippets as Carrion's horde exit past reception to go out for lunch. She overhears Audrey: "I'm scared the woman won't brush her hair. I've told her no socks with crocs or Uggs, that ponchos are banned. But I can't guarantee her speech won't get her canceled."<br><br>
        At 5:30pm Holly rushes from Carrion to the apartment. Before knocking on Virginia's door, she hears conversation inside. Virginia's voice. "I have won the Charlotte's Web! YOU believe it, don't you? I am a champion." A pause. "I am THE champion." Another pause.
        Holly hears the horrible dog bark, but who is Virginia talking to? 
        "Kafka, my heart, I would die of loneliness without you. You're the only boy I can stand. But I need a girlfriend," Virginia says. "Coming home from the ceremony would be like a popstar all alone in their hotel after their epic concert." Holly hears Kafka woof again and Virginia replying, "You're right, Kafka, you're clearly a critic of melodrama, and what I'm saying is not true: YOU'LL be here, and I'll host an after-party. When I've finished having sex with this girlie I'll start inviting everyone. Meanwhile, sex with this woman could be the answer to it all: loneliness, touch starvation, boredom, ennui, indecision, power loss, writer's block, lack of fun, fears, and any other emotion." Virginia laughs. "And then... How big should I make my celebration party?! I will invite some press acquaintances too. And that literati-"It"-girl, Samira Sato?! Maybe I could only invite women and actually ENJOY myself! Or would that be career suicide? Ha! Could ANYTHING be career suicide after such a win as the Charlotte?!"<br><br>
        A frightened Holly knocks. Virginia opens the door, this time wearing a muumuu, grubby track-pants, and Ugg boots. 
        "Heeyy, Red-Head," Virginia drawls, her hand on her hip. "Come in, honey."
        Virginia's laugh, like her voice, is a croak: hoarse in a way that reminds Holly to get the latest flu shot. Virginia steps closer and all Holly sees are her eyes protruding. Holly feels both faintness and the sensation that someone is squeezing her wrist like an ever-tightening bangle and in these strange seconds confusion reigns: Is it her imagination or is there really a vice grip on her right wrist? 
        What would Grandma have advised, she thinks wildly. Holly's grandmother had told Holly she was born to be a 'helper.' A prophecy Holly has never warmed to; she surmises that after thirty-five years of trying to live up to the decree, that it's very hard to be what one was born to be.
        "I think I know your news," says Holly hesitantly. "Congratulations, Virginia!" 
        Virginia lets her grip go and nervously Holly scuffs her flats into Virginia's hallway rug littered in dog toys.
        "It's incredible!" says Virginia. "I just wish I could accept the award with Kafka. I'd tell 'em, I can't write without him. Together we lounge on the bed with the laptop, Kafka barking when I stop typing."
        They both look at Kafka. 
        Outside the dirty window it's raining now. Holly loathes the dog that's now barking at her and wishes she were in the rain. She looks at Virginia's books, all in a row, plus their translations in thirty-seven languages. She skitters from one end of the bookcase to the other.
        The rain seems to make Virginia horny. She walks over and touches Holly's hip.
        Holly feels the opposite of helpful. And she feels hypervigilant. Virginia closes her bulging eyeballs, so Holly shuts down her eyes too. It intensities the repulsion and strain. Eyes springing open, Holly sees the fang coming towards her. Dumbly frozen, she feels it press then splice her lip. When the shock wears off it's replaced with a spasm of disgust. Then a fluttering panic. Holly tells herself it's good to get her first kiss, even though her grandmother had said she was better off without such things. But her heart thumps more and more violently and the kiss does not seem to be ending so Holly pushes Virginia but her hands accidentally use Virginia's breasts to push, which only excites Virginia more. Holly, the definition of decorum, instead decides to cough and splutters a polite "ahem" into Virginia's open mouth on hers, and when Virginia moves her head back and swears, Holly twists her head so fast it's nearly whiplash, and says in the flash of the inspired, "Sorry! I just remembered my dog allergy."
        "What happens to you?" Virginia's tone is not pleased. 
        "Hives!" Holly steps further back. "Coughing, as you see! And the usual..."
        "Hives, hey? You'll have to show me them," Virginia says playfully, recovering, then Holly feels Virginia's arm around her waist, pulling her, and it occurs to the receptionist that all of this could be seen as an honor. It is VIRGINIA GARG, and she is lucky that this author could want something from her, that she should always remember her grandmother's words that she is a HELPER, and that that is her calling and that she must always practice gratitude. 
        "Thank you," Holly whispers, depressed.
        Virginia grabs Holly's wrist again, the one which isn't purpling, to usher her into the living room. Holly touches the lip that feels like it's been sliced by a blade. Blood is on her finger. Don't freak out, Holly thinks.
        "Thanks for coming over, honey. You're a good kisser."
        "Oh. I AM?" Holly is simultaneously flattered and revolted.
        "You know you are, you minx." 
        Virginia pours them champagne in crystal flutes.
        Holly has never tried alcohol before. Her grandmother forbade it. Taking a sip, she winces. One sip will be enough. If she can get away with it. When Virginia raises an eyebrow, Holly's trembling hands spill the fancy drink on her dress. Virginia is too quick with the napkins.
        "Oh!" Holly says in protest. A short circuit is in her brain. No coherence. No thoughts.
        "What do you want as your safe word?"
        "Oh. What?"
        Holly wonders if Virginia might sense her frozen state: that although thoughts are whirring she can't talk and is maybe useless.
        Virginia leans forward. "It's okay, honey, we don't need words."
        Then Virginia kisses Holly again. It's worse this time. Holly is stricken by the red tongue of the author, that thick, insistent slab, in the black hole of her mouth, with that sword-tooth, invading, making little blood-slices of her own mouth, and then- like a battering ram - opening, prizing wide, to enter, probe, touch the roof, poke her gums, clean her teeth, touch her tonsils.
        Holly, panicking, pulls Virginia's hair - jolts it up in a frantic yank. Then she sprints down the hall to the door, grabbing her bag at the entrance, as she hears Virginia swear in surprise and Kafka bellow.<br><br>

        When Holly returns to her studio in Hell's Kitchen, a sub-lease with no radiator or air-conditioning, she lies in bed. Closes her eyes - numb. One thought arises; it sticks around invasively: it's the epiphany that Holly had felt when her grandmother had died - the realization that Holly was a tectonic plate breaking away from its body of land to become an island. The guilt from this had made her throw herself on the dead-cold chest of her grandmother and cry in obedience, trying to attach herself to landmass once more.
        The thought, the feeling, is so intense that Holly considers going back and apologizing to Virginia Garg. Virginia Garg LIKED her. And she'd ran out rudely, not using her words, completely inept, an unfit member of the human race for leaving like that. Holly stares at the ceiling cracks. I wish I were a clear communicator like an author, she thinks. It's no wonder Virginia misread my feelings! Holly stares at one crack which looks like the vulture logo that's the bane of her existence at work. She wishes she had a friend so she could get a hug, so she could survive all this. But she wouldn't know how to go about making a friend. Her grandmother had told her friends were unnecessary because Holly had her. "I hate you, Grandma," Holly says aloud, surprising herself because she didn't know she did. She wonders, Is it possible to get another job? 
        No.
        It is not!
        It is not possible!
        Holly believes she's not one of these people who can just get a job. This position is the one and only golden egg. But meeting the authors that come in... She doesn't want to do that anymore. 
        Holly never wanted for money when she was looking after her grandmother but after the will was read out Holly realized money would be a factor now that her grandmother had given every cent and the brownstone to a psychic on television that her grandmother had found "inspiring." The miracle of the job at Carrion has given Holly her first bank account. Stricken, Holly listens to noises in the room: cars whizzing by, horns and alarms, sirens wailing, the clanging pipe, a neighbor playing show-tunes, a violin 'practicing,' and a neighbor playing a meditation of whale acoustics. Hell. In the night Holly worries her wound has become septic; it looks like a lobster has taken residence on her lip.<br><br>

        It's raining the next day too. At lunch break Holly accepts the rain like she accepted her lot with her grandmother, and without an umbrella finds a semi-waterproof bus shelter. She turns her cell on. Oh God, she had pulled the author's hair. She needs to call and beg Virginia - to make everything alright - but she's too petrified of her to call.<br><br>

        Back at her desk, Holly receives an email from her manager. He has set up a meeting with himself, Holly, and HR, tomorrow. Holly doesn't think it's a promotion. Now she really needs to call Virginia. She feels faint and can't do her job properly.<br><br>

        When Holly arrives home she calls. The phone is answered and Holly is surprised to hear background party noises. Virginia's first words are a teasing "We're waiting for you, Belle!"
        "Yeah! Hurry up! The alcohol's running out!" Holly hears another woman holler. There's some whoops.
        "I'm not Belle. Sorry! This is Holly Emmerson speaking. Um. Receptionist? You are having a party? Sorry. I was hoping I could um talk to you-"
        "Not interested."
        "Sorry! I didn't know if I should be calling you - I'll be very quick - I just want to say-"
        "I. Am. Not. Interested. Goodbye." 
        Holly hears a man say, "Must be a damned telemarketer."
        "Just one second more. Please!" begs Holly. "I'm so sorry to call when you're celebrating... And-" Her tone is tremulous, questioning. "I don't want... hurt, I guess. That's all. And-"
        "Seriously," seethes Virginia. "I'm hanging up now. I'm not interested in your telemarketing."
        "Wait! Oh! One more second! PLEASE help me, Virginia! I think they're going to fire me tomorrow because you must have told them I left your place so rudely. If you could help? I know we were going to be, um, friends before... that... I mean, er, what happened... and- Oh! I'm sorry that I don't, um, want to be more than friends - I know you do, and I was upset about... and I know you're busy now... but... Oh! To lose my job is the end of the-"
        Virginia hangs up.<br><br>

        Holly gets no sleep and is shaky and tearful. The HR meeting at 9am is brutal. Holly's fired for being an "erotomaniac-stalker." Virginia has stated that the receptionist had the audacity to VISIT her premises! A restraining order will take effect, as well as the dismissal. When asked to speak, Holly cannot. She leaves Carrion Books for the last time in tears. <br><br>

        The fracas receives a minute's air-time on Twitter. Audrey Ford tweets "No-one's famous til they get a stalker." But Samira Sato rocks the thread; the twenty-nine-year-old Japanese-American genius memoirist/journalist, tweets how "funny" it is that Virginia seems to "collect" stalkers. "Doesn't everyone remember Garg's stalker from last year?! The girl who worked at the Strand?" This tweet of Samira's receives retweets, enough for word to get back to Virginia and cause her and Kafka sleepless nights.<br><br>

        Soon, Holly is evicted because she can't find a job and can't pay rent. But she finds love! A relationship with Samira Sato, in fact. They meet when Samira wants to interview Holly about the stalking allegations for a journalistic piece and they bond over their antagonism with Virginia. It's not long before Holly U-hauls with Samira and Samira helps her land a job at Greenlight bookstore. Holly has never experienced such joy. Her heart finally feels at peace.</p>
